## Usage

In Ecommerce, users will be able to view different aspects of the application or 'online-store' such as "categories", "tags" and "products". Users will be able to view all of the categories, tags and products with a get request. They will also be able to create, update and delete items with a post request, a put request and a delete request. To test the routes, we used 'Insomnia'.
